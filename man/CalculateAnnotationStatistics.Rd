\title{Calculate annotation statistics for all m/z value suggesting the most likely metabolite based on correlated pathway expression.}
\usage{
CalculateAnnotationStatistics(
  data,
  mz.assay,
  pathway.assay,
  mz.slot = "scale.data",
  pathway.slot = "scale.data",
  return.top = TRUE,
  corr_theshold = 0,
  corr_weight = 1,
  n_weight = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A SpaMTP Seurat object containing both metabolite and RAMP_ID assays generated from \code{CreatePathwayAssay}.}

\item{mz.assay}{Character string defining the name of the assay containing m/z features.}

\item{pathway.assay}{Character string matching the name of the assay containing RAMP_ID features (default = "pathway").}

\item{mz.slot}{Character string stating the slot to extract m/z values from (default = "scale.data").}

\item{pathway.slot}{Character string defining the slot to extract pathway features from (default = "scale.data").}

\item{return.top}{Boolean indicating whether to return only the most likely metabolite with it's corresponding pval and score. If set to \code{FALSE}, a list will be returned with statistics for all possible metabolites per m/z (default = TRUE).}

\item{corr_theshold}{Numeric value stating the correlation threshold to consider a pathway as significantly colocalized. If set to \code{0}, all pathways will be counted (default = 0).}

\item{corr_weight}{Numeric weight applied to correlation score in z-score calculation. If significance should be based more on the correlation, increase this value (default = 1).}

\item{n_weight}{Numeric weight applied to number of correlated pathways in z-score calculation (default = 1).}

\item{mz}{Character or numeric. The target m/z feature. If numeric, the closest matching m/z in the dataset will be selected.}
}
\value{
Either a data.frame containing the original annotations for all m/z values and their corresponding most likely metabolite, or a list contating statistics for each m/z value.
}
\description{
This function evaluates the potential biological relevance of an annotation for a given m/z value by:
\itemize{
\item Identifying pathways associated with each possible annotated metabolite
\item Calculating colocalisation score between the m/z intensity and the expression of each corresponding pathway
\item Ranking annotations by a combined z-score based on correlation strength and number of supporting significant pathways
\item NOTE: this function requires \code{CreatePathwayAssay} and \code{CreatePathwayObject} to be run first
